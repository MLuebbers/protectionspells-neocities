Maybe there is some honor in keeping this secret but I didn't come up 
with this name. Protection Spells comes directly from a Songs: Ohia 
album of the same name. I like Jason Molinas work quite a bit and found 
the name evocative. My idea was that the music was some sort of ritual 
we are all partaking in, where the performers casts a protection spell 
over they're audience. I did not know at the time of choosing the name 
that the album was entirely improvized. I feel even more strongly about 
the name now, but I must admit I feel silly saying it outloud.
